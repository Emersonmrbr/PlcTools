# PlcTools

**PlcTools** is an open and modular project aimed at bringing together various PowerShell modules focused on automation, integration, and data manipulation in industrial environments, especially related to PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).

## Overview

This repository serves as a central point for the development and distribution of PowerShell modules that facilitate common tasks in the context of industrial automation. The idea is to continuously expand the project by adding new modules as needs and community suggestions arise.

## Project Structure

- Each PowerShell module is organized in its own folder, containing scripts, manifests, documentation, and specific configuration files.
- The project already includes the `RssToAcd` module, which converts RSS files to the ACD format using configurable regular expressions.

## How to contribute

Feel free to suggest new modules, report issues, or submit pull requests. The goal is to create a robust and useful collection of PowerShell tools for industrial automation.
