# PowershellModules

**PowershellModules** is an open and modular project aimed at bringing together various PowerShell modules focused on automation, integration, and data manipulation in industrial environments, especially related to PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).

## Overview

This repository serves as a central point for the development and distribution of PowerShell modules that facilitate common tasks in the context of industrial automation. The idea is to continuously expand the project by adding new modules as needs and community suggestions arise.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each representing a specific PowerShell module or tool. For example:

- [`PlcTools`](PlcTools/): A collection of PowerShell tools and modules focused on PLC programming and automation tasks.
  - [`RssToAcd`](PlcTools/RssToAcd/): A module for converting RSS files to ACD format using configurable regular expressions.

Each module contains its own scripts, manifests, documentation, and configuration files.

## How to contribute

Feel free to suggest new modules, report issues, or submit pull requests. The goal is to create a robust and useful collection of PowerShell tools for industrial automation.
