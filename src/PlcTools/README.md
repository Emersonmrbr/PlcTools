# PlcTools

This section of the repository is dedicated to the development of PowerShell tools and modules focused on PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming and automation tasks.

## Overview

**PlcTools** aims to provide a modular and extensible set of utilities to assist engineers and developers working with industrial automation systems. The tools in this section are designed to simplify common tasks such as data conversion, integration, and manipulation related to PLC programming environments.
